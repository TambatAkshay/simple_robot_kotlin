# simple_robot_kotlin
Every day in the morning we need to complete some set of predefined tasks that remain constant. 
We can list the generic tasks as below:
1. Ring the alarm on time 
2. Make coffee 
3. Heat the water to a suitable temperature
4. Pack your bag (Keep only appropriate books for the day) 
5. Cook breakfast and lunch
6. Iron the clothes 
From now on a Kotlin Robot will complete the above set of tasks for us.

SPECIFICATIONS: 
 
About the Robot: Consider the Robot as your personal assistant. 
 
1. Ring the alarm: The Robot will ring the alarm every day at a specified time which will be set by you. You also need to set the days on which the alarm will not ring. 
 
2. Make coffee: The Robot will make coffee for you every day. You need to tell the Robot about the following details: 1. How do you like your coffee (Black/With Milk). 2. How much sugar you’ll take.
 
3. Heat the water: You need to tell the Robot about the temperature you like for your bathing water. Additional information which can be added is whether you’ll be bathing on a particular day or not.
 
4. Pack your bag: The Robot will keep the books in your bag as per your timetable. 

5. Cook breakfast and lunch: The Robot will cook your food according to your taste. You can let the Robot know which food items do you like for breakfast and lunch and it will choose randomly from the list provided by you. 
 
6. Iron the clothes: Just tell the Robot what you want to wear before taking the bath and the clothes will be ready for you as soon as you come out after bathing.
